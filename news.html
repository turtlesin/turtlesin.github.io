				   <p>Eldritch Horror is a game that can be played solo, if you prefer that sort of thing, which is one of the only things that bugs me about it.</p>
						
					<div class="hidden1" >
						<p> If you can play a game by yourself and have mostly the same experience, then it leads to the question, “then why do the players matter?” </p>

						<p>This is a question I always ask myself when playing co-operative games, and I think from that perspective, co-operative games are simply a double-edged sword in that respect. </p>

						<p>Reading cards in spooky voices or in a faux-serious tone does not a good story make when you’re by yourself. </p>

						<p>White clad men and padded rooms may ensue if you’re ever caught. Still, if you’re looking for a story, this is the board game equivalent of reading a story, and your characters are the ones telling it, whether you do it alone or with friends.</p>

						<p>Last year, my prayers were answered, in part, because Fantasy Flight delivered a game that has nearly the perfect mix of complexity, 
						accessibility, and brevity, wrapped in a Lovecraft theme. </p>
			
						<div class="hidden2">
						<p>Eldritch Horror has become the Lovecraft game, in my humble opinion. It’s s phenomenal design in almost every way: 
						it delivers a game that, with four, lasts only about an hour and a half, and most importantly, 
						it comes closest to delivering on the promise of a Lovecraft experience where players feel the dread and the hopelessness that embodies 
						Lovecraft stories, or at least as well as I believe a board game ever can. 
						What I mean by that last part is that most Lovecraft stories are about the characters themselves, their fear, their dread, and an unseen force.</p>

						<p>The “good guys” rarely win, and most of the time they either lose, go insane, or run for their lives. They are most certainly not about four heroes 
						fighting off an Elder God directly, but rather the true conflict in the stories are about people realizing that there’s far more out there than meets the eye, 
						an unseen force, and their ability to rationalize it and overcome their own horror. This is a systemic failure in the board game design community, 
						if that even exists, because with a rich and prolific catalog of stories to choose from, 
						Lovecraft-themed games always seem to revolve around this idea that there’s some heroes doing heroic shit versus an all-powerful evil entity.</p>

			   <p>Now before we get going I just wish to say a few things about last month with the video thing; 
			   I don’t know why I thought it would be easier to make a video, it’s not. There is a lot more work involved than I thought there would be and
			    I have discovered that I am not quite ready for that yet.
			   I need more time and confidence to get it right so, at least for now, no more videos.</p>
